In this assignment we were asked to create a website using a video captured by ourself and creating a website that reflect this video.
I have implmented HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I have used the help of herobiz with some of the codes in CSS and JavaScript.
What I tried to do is mimick the color scheme of the video and try to make it match with the water and ocean aspect but also add the theme of comfort in which if anyone enters the website can understand and easily navigate throughly as simplicity is always preferred nowadays.
The only challenging aspect when creating the website was how I could use the CSS and JavaScript classes into the HTML and try to modify my layout into a specific design.
